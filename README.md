## A Beautiful Game
This article discussed how Deep Blue and AlphaGo may have revealed something interesting about how human thought processes can be replicated. Although these AIs were designed simply to specifically perform at one task, rather than encompass the general intelligence of human brains, they managed to make moves within their respective games that seemed strategic and intuitive to their human opponents. Grandmasters observing Deep Blue's game with Gary Kasparov noted that the machine played like a human, and even with "nuance and subtlety." Similarly, AlphaGo played a "beautiful" game against reigning champion Lee Sedol. Journalist Charles Krauthammer described the situation acutely when he said that when you "build a machine that does nothing but calculation," then "it crosses over and creates poetry." He makes a good point that the most intricate of human thought processes are still just the result of a complex series of neurons firing back and forth. Certainly food for thought, and a solid counterpoint to those who believe that human intelligence is too complicated for machines to ever replicate.
